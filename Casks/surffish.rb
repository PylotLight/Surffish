  caveats <<~EOS
    Surffish is unsigned and not notarized. If macOS reports the app is "damaged",
    verify that it came from the official Surffish release and that you trust it,
    then run:
      xattr -cr /Applications/Surffish.app
    Homebrew's --no-quarantine option is no longer available.
